 \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}

The storage of information in digital format has grown considerably in recent years. Not only people are responsible for producing data, electronic equipment have also become major generators of records, such as servers, GPS devices, computers scattered in various contexts, among a multitude of applications. The term Big Data refers to all this amount of data that is on the order of petabytes and can not be analyzed by traditional methods This work aims to conduct a study on one of the most known architectures to solve these problems, Hadoop software. The development MapReduce paradigm is discussed together with the projects that are built on top of Hadoop system, which provides services at a higher level of abstraction. At the end of the research we propose an architecture for implementing Big Data faces a real case study, which involves the extraction and analysis of social networks with publications focus toward public policy.
